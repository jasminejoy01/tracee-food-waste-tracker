# Tracee Pitch (Excerpt)

**Hook:**  
Meet Stacey, a 29-year-old professional in Toronto.  
She discovers a jar of pasta sauce in her fridge—ten days past the best-before date—and tosses it unopened.

**The Problem:**  
Half of household food waste happens at home. Once groceries leave the store, there’s no tracking.  
Best-before ≠ expiry, but most consumers don’t know the difference.

**Our Solution – Tracee:**  
1. Snap your grocery receipt.  
2. Assign storage location (fridge/freezer/pantry).  
3. App estimates best-before date.  
4. Get alerts before items spoil.  
5. Track what’s used vs wasted and see cost savings.

**Benefits:**  
- Save money and reduce waste.
- Learn buying patterns to shop smarter.
- Optional: recipe ideas, donation drop-off locations, grocery swap with friends.

**Closing:**  
“What’s measured is managed.” Tracee measures household food waste and turns it into actionable insights.
