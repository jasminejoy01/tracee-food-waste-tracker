# Problem Statement

Household food waste is a major environmental and economic problem. In Canada, about half of all food waste happens at home.  
Once groceries leave the store, there is no system to track how much is used vs. wasted. Consumers often misunderstand *best-before* dates, forget about items in storage, and throw out perfectly edible food.

**Key pain points:**
- Misinterpretation of best-before vs expiry dates.
- Lack of visibility into whatâ€™s in the fridge/pantry.
- No data to inform smarter purchasing.

**Impact:**
- Waste of production, transport, and storage resources.
- Increased municipal waste processing costs.
- Higher household grocery bills and taxes.
